- Create opportunities for peer bonding

### 3. Growth Mindset Culture
Fostering belief that abilities can be developed:
- Praise effort over ability
- Teach about brain plasticity
- Emphasize learning from failures
- Set challenging but achievable goals

## Practical Strategies

### Daily Practices
- Morning check-ins with students
- Gratitude journaling
- Mindfulness moments
- Peer appreciation activities

### Crisis Response
- Have a calm-down corner
- Teach self-regulation techniques
- Provide choices during difficult moments
- Follow up after conflicts

### Building Community

## Measuring Resilience
Track progress through:
